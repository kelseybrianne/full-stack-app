# Join In

Join In is an app where users can challenge themselves and others by creating challenges and joining challenges that others have created!

Upon opening the application, you will be prompted to log in. Every user must be logged in to view the homepage, including challenges.

On the homepage you will see one tab for Challenges and one tab for Posts.


**Challenges:**

The challenge tab is where you will see challenges posted by all users. Challenges are time sensitive so you will see a time limit for how long you should partake in each challenge. You have the option to join a challenge by clickin the "join" button and that challenge will be added to "Your Challenges" on the right side 


**Posts:**

The posts tab is where you will see progress updates from users on how they are doing on their challenges. Users can post as often as they'd like to communicate with others and keep themselves accountable.
